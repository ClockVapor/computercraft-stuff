Various scripts for ComputerCraft


## mineColumn
https://pastebin.com/hnrkzi6n

Has a mining turtle dig out an NxN column to the bottom of the world and dump anything it digs into a chest behind where
it starts.

This script is the same as the mining turtle's built-in script `excavate`, except it digs out 3 rows at a time instead
of just 1.
